# python has more than 100 codecs
# These can be used as encoding argument to  open(), str.encode(), bytes.decode()

# common codecs:
# 1. latin1/iso8859_1 : basis for other encodings.
# 2. cp1252 : latin1 superset created by Microsoft which added many symbols. (someplace it is called ANSI, but it is not really ANSI)
# 3. utf-8 : most popular 8-bit encoding. 97% websites uses this.
# 4. utf-16-le (little-endian): UTF 16 bit encoding scheme type which support code points beyond U+FFFF through escape sequences called surrogate pairs
